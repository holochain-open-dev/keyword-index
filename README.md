# Search Module

Small zome to manage the search in your DNA, in RSM.

This module is designed to be included in other DNAs, assuming as little as possible from those. It is packaged as a holochain zome, and an npm package that offers native Web Components that can be used across browsers and frameworks.

> Notice that this zome still stores all search in the DNA in which the zome is included. Integration and bridging with personas & search will be done in the future, maintaining as much as possible the current API.
